**About me**
=====================
I'm a full-stack developer with a passion for making a positive impact through web development. 

My love for computers began at a young age, where I taught myself HTML and CSS to create themes on the Tumblr platform. This experience solidified my decision to pursue a career in web development, where I can combine my passion for technology with my desire to make a positive impact in the community. 

To achieve this goal, I'm particularly passionate about sharing my personal experiences, writing technical content, and working in Open Source. Because of this, I'm actively involved in the Brazilian tech community and am excited to reach more people by creating content in English. 
I’ve been working in the software development industry for over two years, where I've gained valuable experience in finding efficient and innovative solutions to overcome challenges.

At this moment in my career I’m focusing on building projects using TypeScript, Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS, Prisma/SQL/NoSQL, Express.js, and whenever I discover a new and interesting technology to add to my stack, I enjoy writing articles about it.


**Project Description**
=====================
- Name: [Data Transformation Utilities Using JSON Schemas](https://github.com/postman-open-technologies/gsoc-2023/issues/16)
- Mentor: [@jdesrosiers](https://github.com/jdesrosiers)
- Description: This project aims to provide a set of transformation utilities that utilize the information in a JSON Schema beyond validation. The utilities to be implemented include adding missing values with a default specified in the JSON Schema, removing properties in a JSON document that are not described in the JSON Schema, and converting a query string from a form post to JSON using the JSON Schema to determine the types of the values. The goal is to implement these utilities in any language and ensure compatibility with at least the latest version of JSON Schema. Additionally, the project intends to provide test cases in JSON format to enable others to use them when writing similar tools in different languages. By doing so, the project hopes to contribute to the JSON Schema community and provide valuable resources for developers working with JSON Schema.

**Requirements**
=====================
## **Functional Requirements**


### **Add default values to JSON document**
- Accept a valid JSON Schema and a JSON document as input.
- Assign a default value to a property, object, or items of an array in the JSON document if it is present but has a null or undefined value.
- Add missing properties to an object in the JSON document if a corresponding default value is specified in the JSON schema.
- Add missing items to an array in the JSON document with a default specified in the JSON schema.
- Add properties with default values specified in the JSON schema to the JSON document if they are not present in the document.
- Handle conflicts when multiple defaults are specified for the same property by using the last default specified in the JSON schema (or define a specific priority rule for handling these conflicts).
- If a property or item is missing from the JSON document and no default value is specified in the JSON schema, the utility should not add the property or item to the JSON document and should not modify the existing document in any way.
- Provide clear error messages and handle errors gracefully to minimize disruption to the user.

---
### **Remove properties not described in JSON schema**

- Accept a valid JSON Schema and a JSON document as input.
- Remove properties from an object in the JSON document if they are not described in the JSON schema.
- Remove objects in the JSON document if they are not described in the JSON schema.
- Remove an item from an array that is not described in the schema.
- Provide clear error messages and handle errors gracefully to minimize disruption to the user.

---
### **Convert form post query string to JSON using JSON Schema**


- Convert a query string from a form post to JSON using the JSON schema to determine the types for the values.
- Handle conflicts when a parameter is present in both the query string and JSON schema with different types by using the type specified in the JSON schema.
- Handle cases where the query string contains multiple values for the same property and specify which one (if any) will be used.
- Output the updated JSON document.
- Accept only valid JSON Schema and query strings from a form post (application/x-www-form-urlencoded).
- Convert string values to the appropriate types based on the schema (e.g., "1" to 1 for a number property).
- Ignore properties not described in the schema.
- Manage required properties in the JSON schema:
  - If a required property is not present in the query string, return an error.
  -  If a required property is present in the query string but has an incorrect type, return an error.
- Implement error handling:
  - If an invalid JSON schema is provided, return an error.
  - If an invalid query string is provided, return an error.
Output the converted JSON object.


## **Non-Functional Requirements**

- Implement the project using TypeScript
- Ensure compatibility with the latest version of JSON Schema
- Write well-structured and well-tested code, with tests described in JSON for ease of use by other developers
- Ensure efficiency and the ability to handle large JSON documents and schemas
- Provide clear documentation for users to easily understand how to use the utilities
- Use consistent naming conventions and code style for maintainability and readability

**Implementation**
=====================

### **Add default values to JSON document**

- Design the API interface for the utility:
  - Define the function signature for accepting a JSON Schema and JSON document
  - Determine the output format
- Develop functions to parse and validate the JSON Schema:
  - Parse and validate simple types: string, number, boolean, object, array, and null

- Develop functions to add default values to the JSON document:
  - Add default values to properties, objects, and items of arrays when they are missing or have null or undefined values
  - Handle conflicts when multiple defaults are specified for the same property (using the last default specified or a defined priority rule)
- Implement error handling:
  - Handle invalid JSON schemas and JSON documents
  - Return clear error messages for various error scenarios
- Write unit tests for each function to ensure correctness and reliability
- Write documentation and create user guides for using the utility
