**About me**
=====================
Hello, I'm a full-stack developer with a passion for creating web projects that positively impact people's lives. I've been working in the software development industry for over two years, where I've sought out efficiency and smart solutions to overcome challenges.

My love for computers began when I was young, and I taught myself HTML and CSS to create themes on the Tumblr platform. This experience solidified my decision to pursue a career in web development, where I could combine my passion for technology with my desire to create positive change.

Beyond my work, I'm actively involved in the Brazilian tech community and am eager to expand my reach by creating content in English. I'm particularly passionate about creating programming content and sharing my knowledge with others. Ultimately, my goal is to be a role model for women in the industry and inspire others to pursue their passions in tech.

**Project Description**
=====================
- Name: [Data Transformation Utilities Using JSON Schemas](https://github.com/postman-open-technologies/gsoc-2023/issues/16)
- Mentor: [@jdesrosiers](https://github.com/jdesrosiers)
- Description: This project aims to provide a set of transformation utilities that utilize the information in a JSON Schema beyond validation. The utilities to be implemented include adding missing values with a default specified in the JSON Schema, removing properties in a JSON document that are not described in the JSON Schema, and converting a query string from a form post to JSON using the JSON Schema to determine the types of the values. The goal is to implement these utilities in any language and ensure compatibility with at least the latest version of JSON Schema. Additionally, the project intends to provide test cases in JSON format to enable others to use them when writing similar tools in different languages. By doing so, the project hopes to contribute to the JSON Schema community and provide valuable resources for developers working with JSON Schema.
